# My Books
I love writing, it is one of my favorite hobbies. Since I love writing, I have tried to write actual books as well as maintain a [blog.](https://aspiring-writer.github.io/blog) The first book I ever started writing was... well, bad. It needs a lot of editing and the storyline is a bit confusing. I started writing it when I was very young (12, I think) and it reflects that. I don't know if I will every rewrite that one and finish it, I just haven't found the inspiration for it yet.

The second book is a lot better (in my opinion) and I started writing it around the age of 17. Unfortunately, I reached a dry spot with that one and it never really took off. I have the plot, but not the story itself. I can't figure out a starting for it and it still bugs me today. One day in the near future, I'm sure I will figure out the perfect starting for it and continue to spin the plot into a wonderful story.
