# My Books
I love writing, it is one of my favorite passtimes. Since I love writing, I have tried to write actual books as well as a blog. The first book I ever started writing was... well, bad. It needs a lot of editing and the storyline is a bit confusing. I started writing it when I was very young (12, I think) and it reflects that. I don't know if I will every rewrite that one and finish it, I just haven't found the inspiration for it yet.

The second book is a lot better (in my opinion) and I started writing it around the age of 17. Unfortunately, I reached a dry spot with that one and it never really took off. I have the plot, but not the story itself. I can't figure out a starting for it and it still bugs me today. One day in the near future, I'm sure I will have figure out the perfect starting for it and continue to spin the plot into a wonderful story.

The following is a list of all the books I'm writing. You can find most of them on my sister site, [Writing Buddies](https://writing-buddies.netlify.app), that I created as a free and privacy-conscious alternative to Wattpad and Inkitt. Eventually, you will be able to find them on this site as well.

## Kidnapped and Afraid
This is a thriller that came to me one day when I was trying to start being serious about my writing. Honestly, I keep getting stuck with this one. Many scenes will just come to me, the difficulty lies in connecting those scenes and adding proper transitions. I do feel like it's an interesting story, one where even I am guessing at the ending.

### Description (needs to be edited)
I’m got kidnapped by a stranger who seems to enjoy feeding off of my fear. He won’t let me go but I’m free to escape just so he can drag me back again.

At first, I think he’s a psychopath, but then he starts doing things that seem impossible. Can he really read my mind? How does his eye color change so fast? Is he manipulating my emotions? Why doesn’t he seem to sleep? Why does he keep me imprisoned? Nothing makes sense and the more I dig the more confusing it gets.

He’s not a vampire. He’s not affected by blood, has no problem stalking me during the daylight, and lacks the fangs. He isn’t fae, no pointy ears. He can’t possibly be a werewolf, full moons have come and gone with no change. So, what is he? An alien? Who is he? And how will I finally escape him? Will I ever escape him?

## Test My Fire
I started writing this and *Kidnapped and Afraid* on the same day. They are very similiar in genre, however, this one is more of a mystery than a thriller. 

### Description
(Her)

He killed my parents, not to mention dozens of other people. He’s only known by the Phantom but I will uncover his identity and make him pay. I’m good at this game and I’ll play it till I die. The Phantom thinks he’s good, but he hasn’t met me yet. I play with fire, live in it really. That’s why I’m called the Phoenix Fox. The fire may burn me, but I will extinguish it before it can kill me.

(Him)

Yes, I’m a killer and I’m good at it. Hundreds have tried to find me, none have succeeded and that’s the way I like it. I wasn’t named “The Phantom’’ for nothing. Those who have gotten close I’ve gotten rid of, all except the cunning little spy known as the Phoenix Fox. She was at my brother’s party and now she’s in my head. I should kill her, I really should. She’s gotten too close and she knows it. She keeps toying with me, jumping in and out of the crossfire. She’s good at the game, but I’m better. The clock is ticking and I’m good at waiting. I know she’ll come to me, they always do. And when she does, I’ll take care of her too. Here little fox, come test my fire.

## Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Know A Secret?
This is hands-down my favorite manuscript right now. It is so fun to write and the words just flow from my head onto my paper. It is a clean romance story and I think it will be a novella (little novel; longer than a short story and the plot and characters are a bit more detailed/developed).

### Description
All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn’t be farther away. But then the Stone’s show up.

Caden Stone is... hot. That’s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He’s just the guy she should avoid, one that likes trouble. Avoiding him isn’t that hard, even though he watches her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden’s half-sister, has other plans.

Jennifer Stone is that blond brat that everyone has met at least once and either befriends her immediately or loathes her forever. She wasn’t really a problem until she decided she wanted to uncover all of Sasha’s past and reveal every little secret, and that’s ignoring the fact that she seems to want to hook Sasha up with Caden for God knows why.

Sasha has a lot of secrets and they’re kept that way for very good reasons. Those secrets can kill and there are people who would kill for them. If Sasha doesn’t stop Jennifer, there’s going to be a war and the whole town might get destroyed in the crossfire.

Do you wanna know a secret? Because I’ve got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesn’t kill me first.

## Murder in the Woods (title might change)
This one is not available online yet and will probably be available here first. It is a short story and will probably be finished before all the others. It is part of a new plan I'm trying out, basically, writing one or two short stories a month. I hear it's good practice and helps exercise your imagination. I have heard it said many times and I do believe that short stories are a good way to start your writing journey. Perhaps, that's why I'm having trouble with my other stories...
