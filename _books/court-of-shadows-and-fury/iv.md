# IV

Faelyn watched as Nixarza fought, it almost looked like she was toying with the jotunn. He scanned the battlefield, it was difficult to tell who was winning as both sides had fallen warriors. Folluin was dancing around a jotunn as it spit curses at him. Faelyn smiled, now this was the battle he had been expecting when his army had ambushed VÃ¡lgr. That pack had just finished sacking a city to the east and were not prepared for the fae or their magic.

Faelyn pulled the ring out of his pocket and examined it. Symbols ran across the surface in a language he did not understand, but he could tell it was an ancient one. There was no hint of its importance or a clue as to who the woman who sought it was. Faelyn briefly wondered if she knew what was written on it and was just as ancient. He glanced back at her. She was a warrior, that much he could tell as she fought against the jotunn commander. Never once did she falter or miss a target. She was powerful, he had sensed that the moment their eyes locked, and that appeased his magic. He could feel it, some sort of bond between them that he did not understand. Had she spelled him somehow? He looked at the ring in his hand. If she wanted it so much she would have to explain what she had done, and perhaps then he would give the ring to her. In the meantime, he did not wish to lose it. Faelyn placed the ring on his finger. Old and powerful magic surged into him. It was too much all at once. He fell to his knees and screamed as pain tore through his body. Roaring filled his ears and he could feel his body taring apart under the magic's force.

"Faelyn!" Folluin screamed, "Faelyn!"

The power, it was too much. Faelyn tried to speak, to tell his friend what was happening but he could not form words through the excruciating pain.

*'Stop it both of you!'*

Nixarza grabbed Faelyn, *'Release it or it will kill you!'* she screamed in to his mind.

He could not, he didn't know how, his brain just would not function.

"Do something!" Folluin shouted.

She snarled, *'Fools, both of you.'* She yanked Faelyn up, *'Thrust out your hands, will the power to release from your fingertips to your enemy. Exhale it out from your mouth. Do the same thing you do with your shadows. Breathe Faelyn, breathe. I can only take so much back without killing you as well.'*

He tried to calm his breathing and focus on her words. He could feel some of the power being pulled from him and he shoved more towards the pull.

*'Good, keep doing that, prince.'*

He did and the pain began to lessen enough for him to breathe a little. He took a few deep breaths while he continued to push the power out and back to her. Soon, he could open his eyes and look up. Nixarza and Folluin were watching him. Faelyn looked past them at the battle still raging on. The commander was closer than before and he was watching them.

*'Better, prince?'*

He looked at Nixarza, "Yes." He stood, "The ring, it is a tether to your power."

She nodded.

"That is why you did not want me to have it; so I would not have control over you."

*'All I wanted was my freedom.'* She snarled, *'it has been too long since I have had it.'*

"I could give it back to you, for a price."

She scoffed, *'Why not continue your foolish streak...'*

"I am not-"

"Dragonkin!" Aglfot bellowed, "Have you forgotten our battle?"

Nixarza growled at the beast approaching them. His arm was limp yet still intact, she would have to hit harder next time.

"Dragonkin?" Folluin faced him, "Be more specific, jotunn. We have all been wondering what she is."

"I am Aglfot, fae scum. Remember my name for I will be the last opponent you face."

Folluin laughed, "And I am Folluin Zingolor,"He beckoned to Faelyn, "hand to Faelyn Farwynn, the next king to the Shadow Court. Remember my name so that you may tell it to all your kin in the hell realm once I send you there."

Aglfot laughed, "I cannot be bested by a small fae like you, no matter what court you hail from."

*'Idiots, all of you.'*

Faelyn chuckled, "Nixarza believes we are all idiots."

"So, you have put on the ring and survived, most interesting; I did not think fae were strong enough to handle my cousin's magic, let alone that of such a feared member of the Dragonkin."

"Yes about that," Faelyn interrupted, "which member, exactly, are we speaking of."

Aglfot chuckled, "You truly do not know whom you have bound to you? Foolish boy, very foolish indeed."

Folluin rolled his eyes, "Oh, get on with it already."

"So eager to have your bones crushed to dust, do you not wish to savor the last few seconds of your life?"

"Immortality gets old," Faelyn grabbed his daggers, "you learn to dance with death just for fun."

Folluin bowed, "Well said, my prince."

Nixarza rolled her eyes, *'I may just let him kill you both.'*

"You need not fight my battles for me, Nixarza."

Aglfot laughed, "It would be wise of you to let the dragon shifter assist you in this battle, fae prince."

"Dragon shifter, you say?" Folluin shifted to his defense position, "Do you even know what 'specific' means?"

"If you best me, elf, I shall be more specific for you."

"It's a deal, ogre."

Nixarza just rolled her eyes and stood by while the three continued to taunt each other.

Aglfot made the first move&mdash;he swung his axe down onto where Faelyn and Folluin were a split-second ago. The two fae danced around the jotunn's legs and slashed at his thighs. Aglfot yelled and swung his axe at them. Shadows surged up and engulfed Aglfot from the waist up. With Aglfot blinded, the fae took to slashing his legs into ribbons. Aglfot roared and lightning surged from him, throwing the fae several feet. Nixarza took that opportunity to send a blast of hellfire to his dangling right arm. Aglfot roared again as fire engulfed his arm. Folluin leapt up and shoved his broadsword into the flaming limb. Nixarza laughed as the arm fell to the ground and was eaten up by her flames.

"You will pay for that elf!" Aglfot screamed.

Faelyn yelled his warning but it was too late. Magic slammed into Folluin and froze him solid.

"As for you, fae prince," Aglfot smiled as Faelyn tried to free himself from the jotunn's grip, "I will take you back to my camp and slowly carve out your bones. Your screaming will be music to my ears and I will savor it for centuries to come."

Nixarza laughed and Faelyn turned to her. *'I told you, prince, you would not beat this jotunn on your own. Where is your army?'*

The battlefield was thinning out and it was becoming clear that the fae were badly losing. Many orcs and ogres dotted the field and they were quickly cutting off the fae in their path.

*'You are losing Faelyn, this battle was never going to end well.'* Nixarza smirked. *'In your arrogance you did not see the entirety of your enemies.'*

"Do something." Faelyn snarled.

*'Give me back my ring.'*

"If you destroy them, I'll consider it."

Nixarza growled at him.

"What," Aglfot sneered, "are you two scheming, blood carver?"

Nixarza just smiled, the oaf had more creative names for her than for the fae lords. *'Swear you will give me the ring.'*

"I swear I'll give you the ring," Faelyn snarled, "*if* you destroy them all."

*'Good.'*

Two flaming blades appeared in her hands as she faced the jotunn.

"You would turn against me now that I am about to crush your new master?" Aglfot faced her, "I could rip the ring from his hand and give it you and together we could rid the Realms of the fae, starting with the Shadow Realm."

Nixarza cocked her head and stared at him. Was that what the jotunn wanted then? To conquer the fae and their territories? Or, perhaps it was the Rifts and ley lines they truly desired, the gateways into other realms and worlds were a special prize. She chuckled, the fae would destroy them long before the jotunn ever made them yield, if that was even possible.

"Well, draconian, what do you say?"

Nixarza just laughed and launched herself straight up into the sky. Like a rocket she flew up until she was only a speck in the sky. She could see the entire battlefield, the fae were surrounded by goblins and orcs as jotunn watched from the sidelines. She reached into the depths of her power and curled the embers of fire around her fingers.

She dove straight down into the middle of the fae army and slammed her fist to the ground. Each goblin, orc, or jotunn her magic touched screamed in pain and terror as fire burned and shadows conjured up images from the very pits of the Hell Realm. Many turned on each other, lashing out at the horrors that were barred to their mind. Only the fae were spared and watched their enemies with confusion.

Nixarza spied Aglfot at the edge of the army. She had spared the jotunn and smiled as he turned to her with anger and fear. The fae prince and his second were no longer near Aglfot. She sensed them running through the midst of the enemy army towards her and their allies. Once the two neared the edge of their army, Folluin immediately ordered a retreat towards the West.

Nixarza approached the prince, *'My ring, fae.'*

Faelyn jerked his head towards Aglfot, "That one is still alive."

*'I want him alive, as a warning to the rest of his people. And he owes you something, doesn't he?'*

Faelyn just eyed her, "The agreement was for *all* of them, not most."

*'Be happy I even helped you, I could have let them kill you all.'* She snapped.

"And why did you?"

She smiled, *'Fae are easier to kill.'*

Faelyn glanced around the battlefield. His army ran through their enemies and even felled some with little effort. An entire legion, driven mad by a single being and rendered harmless.

He turned to her, "What are you?"

She watched him closely, *'A child of two worlds, a union that should never have happened and has since been forbidden.'*

"Which worlds?"

She shook her head, *'Give me the ring, Faelyn.'*

"Perhaps I should keep it, having your power will prove useful." He began to walk towards his army, "And you have yet to remove your spell."

*'My spell?'*

Faelyn turned to her, "The moment our eyes met, magic stirred and wrapped itself around me. I assumed it was you."

So he had felt the bond snap into place, but he didn't know what it was. How much this fae prince didn't know was unacceptable. *'You have Fate to question for that, not I, and it is not a spell.'*

"If it is not a spell, what is it?"

Nixarza glanced at the fae army miles away, *'They are waiting for you.'*

"What has Fate woven around me?"

Nixarza glanced at him, *'A curse for the both of us, I'm sure.'*

"I don't understand."

She rolled her eyes, *'Your ignorance, not mine.'*

Nixarza grabbed his arm and launched into the air.

Faelyn cried out, "What are you doing?!"

*'You are too slow, reinforcements will arrive soon and your army should be long gone by then.'*

"The jotunn have many allies."

Nixarza landed beside Folluin and gazed towards the North. *'They have too many.'*

Faelyn turned towards his second, "We need to conjure up a larger army to take down this threat."

Folluin eyed Nixarza, "And what of the spoils and prisoners? Many of them still live and wish to know their fate."

"The spoils belong to the finders."

Folluin smiled, "Including the slaves?"

Faelyn nodded, "Let the soldiers chose what they wish to do with them."

Nixarza narrowed her eyes, *'Free the slaves.'*

Folluin snarled, "Is that an order?"

Faelyn raised an eyebrow, "I thought only I was cursed to hear her."

*'I speak to whom I wish.'*

"I wouldn't call it speaking, witch."

She growled at Folluin, *'I am no witch, halfling.'*

Surprise laced Folluin's face, but he quickly covered it, "Then what are you?"

Nixarza smiled, *'Wouldn't you love to know?'*

The two glared at each other.

"Now," Faelyn interrupted, "is not the time nor the place. As for you," He turned to her, "I'm sure my father will be able to shed some light as to your origin and your new purpose to us."

*'And what makes you think I will follow you into the Shadow Realm?'*

Faelyn held up his hand, "You are my slave, aren't you?"

She scowled at him, *'Careful prince, I am not an easy slave to control.'*

"I certainly hope not," He smiled, "or else this will be very boring for us both."

*'So, I am to be your new toy?'*

"If you prefer that term."

Nixarza snarled, *'You will pay for this, shadowsinger.'*
