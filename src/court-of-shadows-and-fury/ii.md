# II

It was nearly two days of marching and pillaging before the army was near there next target&mdash;Carlhaven, a well-populated city full of many different species and cultures. Attacking this city was making a bold statement for only the very powerful, or very foolish, would consider it.

Válgr and his army were full of anticipation for the mighty battle ahead. Nixarza hated it. Every soldier was either sparring or preparing weapons. Nixarza watched them all with boredom and pity. Válgr hadn't revealed his master plans yet, but she was sure it involved rivers of blood and world enslavement. It was sickening. All of these men would be drunk on the spoils and numb to the reality that the being they blindly followed was a jotunn to the core and would rule with an iron fist.

Any moment now, Válgr would begin giving put orders and the army would march on to siege and overthrow Carlhaven. No warrior had ever made it near the mighty city's gates, if Válgr got that far it was making a big statement. 

There was once a time when Nixarza herself would have been beside herself with glee at the prospect of conquering a stronghold like this one. But that was when battles were worth fighting; when heroes were bound by honor and evil slithered into ever crevice, waiting to strike. This war was just to appease the pride of one jotunn who considered himself above everyone else. Utterly pointless.

It was with disgust and anger that Nixarza was forces to fight under his banner. And it was why she always found a way to make it harder for Válgr.
